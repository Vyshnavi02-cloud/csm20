📄 ABSTRACT

In today’s digital era, effective communication between citizens and government authorities remains a significant challenge, particularly in the area of public grievance redressal. Many complaints related to civic issues, public safety, infrastructure, utilities, and corruption either go unreported or remain unresolved due to lack of transparency, accountability, and proper tracking mechanisms. To address this gap, this project proposes the development of a Smart Public Grievance Redressal System, a centralized digital platform that enables citizens to directly submit complaints to the appropriate higher authorities in a structured, secure, and transparent manner.

The proposed system allows users to register, select the relevant sector (such as municipal services, electricity, transport, police, etc.), describe their issue, and upload supporting proof in the form of images, videos, or documents. The platform incorporates an intelligent verification module that validates the authenticity of submitted evidence using automated checks and moderation mechanisms to reduce false or duplicate complaints. Once verified, complaints are automatically routed to the concerned authorities based on sector and location mapping.



📘 1. INTRODUCTION

Public service systems play a vital role in maintaining infrastructure, safety, and social well-being. Citizens frequently face problems related to roads, water supply, sanitation, electricity, and public safety. Among these, women safety has become a critical social issue, especially in urban and semi-urban areas. Incidents such as harassment, stalking, unsafe public transport, and poorly lit areas often go unreported due to social stigma, lack of awareness, or difficulty in accessing higher authorities.

Traditional complaint mechanisms require citizens to physically visit offices or rely on phone calls, which are time-consuming and ineffective, particularly in emergency or sensitive situations like women safety concerns. Although some digital grievance systems exist, many lack features such as proof-based complaint submission, real-time tracking, and direct escalation to higher authorities.

With the increasing use of smartphones and internet connectivity, mobile applications provide an effective platform for addressing both general public complaints and women safety issues. The proposed system aims to provide a centralized and transparent solution that empowers citizens—especially women—to report issues securely, upload evidence, and receive timely responses from concerned authorities. This project supports e-governance initiatives and promotes safer and more accountable public service systems.



📊 2. DATA SURVEY

A data survey was conducted to analyze common public problems and the limitations of existing grievance redressal systems. The survey included feedback from citizens across different age groups and locations.

2.1 Identified Problem Areas

The survey identified the following major complaint sectors:

Road and transportation problems

Water supply and drainage issues

Electricity and power-related failures

Sanitation and waste management

Public safety concerns

Women safety issues such as harassment, unsafe public spaces, and lack of immediate response


2.2 Observations from the Survey

Key findings from the survey include:

Many citizens are unaware of proper complaint channels

Delays in resolution reduce public trust

Lack of proof submission leads to complaint rejection

Women hesitate to report safety issues due to fear and privacy concerns

Absence of real-time tracking and feedback


2.3 Survey Conclusion

The survey results indicate a strong need for a secure, proof-based, and user-friendly mobile complaint system that also prioritizes women safety. Providing features such as confidential reporting, direct authority access, and evidence submission can encourage more women to report incidents and help authorities take timely action.




📚 3. LITERATURE SURVEY

3.1 Overview

The literature survey examines existing research on public grievance management systems, e-governance platforms, and digital solutions for women safety. Various studies highlight the role of technology in improving citizen participation, safety, and transparency.


3.2 Existing Public Grievance Systems

Many governments have introduced online portals and mobile applications to handle public complaints related to infrastructure and services.

Advantages:

Digital record maintenance

Improved accessibility

Reduced paperwork

Limitations:

Limited support for mobile users

Lack of proof verification

Manual complaint handling

Slow response to critical issues, including women safety complaints


3.3 Women Safety Applications

Several women safety applications provide emergency alerts, SOS buttons, and location sharing features. While these apps offer immediate assistance, research indicates that:

Many lack integration with official authorities

Complaints are not formally recorded

There is no proper follow-up or accountability


3.4 Proof-Based Verification and Automation

Recent studies suggest integrating proof submission and verification mechanisms such as image validation, audio evidence analysis, and location metadata checking. These techniques improve the reliability of complaints and help authorities prioritize serious cases, especially those related to women safety.


3.5 Research Gap

Based on the literature review, the following gaps are identified:

No unified platform for public complaints and women safety issues

Lack of automated proof verification

Poor complaint prioritization for safety-related cases

Limited transparency and tracking mechanisms

The proposed system addresses these gaps by providing a single mobile platform that supports both general public grievances and women safety complaints with verification, authority mapping, and real-time updates.



4.Problem Statement

In many regions, citizens face significant difficulties in reporting public issues such as infrastructure damage, sanitation problems, electricity failures, public safety concerns, and corruption. Existing grievance redressal systems are often manual, fragmented, or poorly managed, resulting in delayed responses, lack of transparency, and minimal accountability from concerned authorities. Complaints may be ignored, misplaced, or not properly tracked, leaving citizens unaware of the status of their submissions. Additionally, there is no effective mechanism to verify the authenticity of complaints or ensure that unresolved issues are escalated to higher authorities within a defined timeframe.

The absence of a centralized, secure, and intelligent platform reduces public trust in governance systems and limits effective citizen participation. Therefore, there is a need to develop a digital, transparent, and automated grievance redressal system that enables citizens to submit verified complaints directly to appropriate authorities, track progress in real time, and ensure timely resolution through structured escalation and monitoring mechanisms.
